# Project-3

***Made with React JS, Node JS, MongoDB, Firebase Authentication***

***To see how it works, follow these instructions:***
- Register with a new email or log in using the following credentials:
  - email: rpaulin1990@gmail.com
  - password: password
- Click on the team name "Southside Strikers" to enter the team's page
- Click on the "Calendar" option on the top navbar
  - click on a calendar slot (some date in the future...)
  - a modal will pop up, enter a name for the event and a note you would like the team to read
  - submit the form and press the "go back" arrow on your browser to return to the team page
- You should see the event you just created and the following options:
  - send reminder: will send an SMS reminder to the phone numbers of the players in the roster
  - confirm attendance: will populate the "confirmed to go" panel with the user's name
- Below you will see a soccer field with eleven "players"
  - to move each player, double click on them and drag them accross the field
  - you can edit the text on each player by clicking on the text field
  - when you are satisfied with your lineup, click the green save button at the top of the field
  - now everyone in the team will be able to see that lineup :)
- If you want to check out who's in your team, click on the "Roster" option on the top navbar and a modal will pop up with each player's information.

If you want someone else to join your team, share the code that is on the top of the left panel (has a "copy to clipboard option"). Others will have to type that code in the "join a team" input area and hit submit. They will be able to see all the information the manager has provided and will be able to confirm their attendance to the next event.

That's it! Below is an explanation of why I made this website and a short tour through its features (with images!).

---

This website was created with the objective of solving a personal problem. I am part of a soccer team that plays in a Sunday league in Houston, Texas. The problem is that we never know who will actually show up to the game and by the time the game is about to begin, we scramble to put together a lineup and explain people their roles. 

This website serves as a team management tool. The users can create or join a team using a unique code that is given to the team creator.

On the team page, the team manager can create events using the calendar option.

Once an event is created, every team member will be able to see the next event's information on the team page. Users will also be able to confirm their attendance.

Lastly, the team manager can send SMS reminders to the team members whenever he wants.

A very important feature of this management tool is the lineup section. In this section, the team manager can edit the position and name of each player and save the lineup. The rest of the team will then be able to see that lineup the next time they log into their account.

As a bonus, the team roster is also available to everyone so they can look at contact info for each player and put a face to every name (believe it or not, sometimes people don't know who is who in a team...free agents).
